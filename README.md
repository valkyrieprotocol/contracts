# Valkyrie Contracts
This mono repository contains the source code for the smart contracts implementing Valkyrie Protocol on the Terra blockchain.

You can find information about the architecture, usage, and function of the smart contracts on the official Valkyrie Protocol documentation [site](https://docs.valkyrieprotocol.com).

## Development

### Environment Setup

- Rust v1.53.1+
- `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target
- Docker

1. Install `rustup` via https://rustup.rs/

2. Run the following:

```sh
rustup default stable
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

3. Make sure [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is installed

### Unit / Integration Tests

Each contract contains Rust unit tests embedded within the contract source directories. You can run:

```sh
cargo unit-test
```

### Compiling

After making sure tests pass, you can compile each contract with the following:

```sh
RUSTFLAGS='-C link-arg=-s' cargo wasm
cp ../../target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/cw1_subkeys.wasm .
ls -l cw1_subkeys.wasm
sha256sum cw1_subkeys.wasm
```

#### Production

For production builds, run the following:

```sh
docker run --rm -v "$(pwd)":/code \
  --mount type=volume,source="$(basename "$(pwd)")_cache",target=/code/target \
  --mount type=volume,source=registry_cache,target=/usr/local/cargo/registry \
  cosmwasm/workspace-optimizer:0.11.5
```

This performs several optimizations which can significantly reduce the final size of the contract binaries, which will be available inside the `artifacts/` directory.
